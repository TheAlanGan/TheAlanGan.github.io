I am currently a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](stat.osu.edu) at The Ohio State University. I previously earned my BS in Mathematics at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](math.utk.edu). Some of my undergraduate work concerned mathematically modeling the viscoelatic properties of cancer cells. We used our model to consider how cancer cells react and deform under external forces and simulate cancer cells flowing and squeezing through microfluidic channels. Some of my other undergraduate work included mathematically modeling the interacting effects harvesting plants and hunting their seed dispersers have on the population abundance and persistence of these plant-disperser systems. We published our findings in [Ecological Modelling](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109328). My current broad research interests include Bayesian methods, computational statistics, MCMC techniques, mathematical modeling, and application-oriented research in ecology and social science.
